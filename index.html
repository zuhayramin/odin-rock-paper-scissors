            Welcome to my take on The Odin Projects Rock Paper Scissors Game
        </h2>
        <p>
            As per the requirements of the project, this version of the game is
            only playable on the developer console <br />
            Therefore, you will need to open up the developer console to see the
            results of the game. <br /><br />
            <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
